# Formatting

=== "Text with suggested changes"
    
    ```
    Text can be { --deleted--} and replacement text { ++added++}. This can also be
    combined into { ~~one~>a single~~} operation. { ==Highlighting==} is also
    possible { >>and comments can be added inline<<}.
    
    { ==
    
    Formatting can also be applied to blocks by putting the opening and closing
    tags on separate lines and adding new lines between the tags and the content.
    
    ==}
